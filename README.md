#Sanic Mode

A demonstration of some stupid things you can do with a Mac Application.

##Features

- Chromeless windows
- No Dock icon (bonus: doesn't appear in the Force Quit menu)
- Command-Q does not quit the application
- Stealing window focus (via `NSApplication` `activateIgnoringOtherApps:`)
- [sanic](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/sanic-hegehog)

##Help

- **This is too fast for me. How do I stop it?**

  Open Activity Monitor, find `sanic-mode`, then try to click the
  quit/stop-sign-with-an-X button, then try to click the **Force Quit** button.

- **Can I download the app without having to build it?**
